# 🧭 LLM Steering (NLP Project)

This repository contains a project developed for a **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** course, focused on **steering the behavior of large language models** through internal representations and activation based methods.

---

## 📌 Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a wide range of behaviors that are not explicitly programmed but emerge from training on large-scale data.  
This project explores **steering techniques**, aiming to influence model outputs by modifying internal activations rather than retraining or fine-tuning the model.

The work is exploratory and experimental in nature, with the goal of understanding:
- how internal representations relate to model behavior
- how targeted interventions can shift outputs in a controlled way

---

## 🧠 Steering Techniques

The project investigates activation-based steering approaches, including:
- identifying internal directions correlated with specific behaviors
- modifying hidden activations during inference
- observing changes in generation quality and style

The focus is on **mechanistic insight** rather than performance optimization.

---

## 🧪 Experimental Setup

Experiments are conducted using:
- pretrained large language models
- prompt-based evaluation
- controlled activation interventions at inference time

Results are analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively to assess:
- effectiveness of steering
- stability across prompts
- unintended side effects
